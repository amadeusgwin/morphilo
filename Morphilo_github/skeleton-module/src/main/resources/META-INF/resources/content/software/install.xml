     <h2>Installation Procedure</h2>   
     <h3>Requirements</h3>
		<p>
		Provided that you have downloaded the <i>morphilo</i> package
		from the <a href="download.xed" target="_blank">download
		section</a> containing -- besides this documentation -- a folder with
		three .jar-files (morextractor, morphilizer, morquery), a file named <i>dbentry</i>,
		a <i>lib</i> folder with several class files and a SQL-file <i>InitialEntrySetup</i>.
		You should save these files on your hard drive at a location
		convenient to you.
		</p>
		<p>
		The algorithm of the software requires tagged corpora in a
		textfile format although showing the extension <i>.pos</i>. If you
		have only plain texts without any annotations available, you may
		choose a rule based (montytagger) or probablistic (stanford parser)
		tagging method to automatically annotate the corpus. In the latter
		case, you will have to correct the &quot;mistaggings&quot; manually
		while running the Morphilizer component. Make sure you change the file
		extension to <i>.pos</i>. Usually these taggers will save their
		results as <i>.txt</i>.
		</p>
		<p>To set up the toolset, three steps have to be taken.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>item download MySQL-DBMS and install it</li>
			<li>item set up data base schema and tables</li>
			<li>item update the dbentry-file</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Downloading MySQL and Installing the MySQL DBMS</h3>
		If you have already an MySQL client installed and you have access to a
		server with sufficient disc space, you can skip this step. If this is
		not the case, you should download the MySQL-GE and the MySQL Workbench
		GUI-tool from the <a href="http://www.mysql.de/downloads/"
		target="_blank">MySQL webpage</a>. If you choose to run the database
		on your hard drive, pick the community server download, klick the
		downloaded file, and follow the instructions given there.
		<p>Open the Workbench and set up a &quot;new server instance&quot;
		either to your hard drive or to a remote server. For the latter, you
		have to specify the IP-address and login details. Note down the
		IP-address or <i>localhost</i> respectively, the username as well as
		its password. Running it on your hard drive, the presets should
		suffice, but make sure that the server is switched on when using it
		(This is usually done in the system's setup). Then klick on &quot;new
		connection&quot; and connect to the just created instance.</p>
		<h3>Setting up data base schema and tables</h3>
		<p>Open the Workbench, choose &quot;Open SQL Script ... &quot;
		from the file menu, and browse to the morphilo package. Select
		&quot;InitialEntrySetup.sql&quot; and confirm your choice. If you do
		not like the preset database name <i>morphilodb</i>, you have to
		update the SQL script. The easiest way to do this is to use a text
		editor and to exchange each sequence of <i>morphilodb</i> by your
		choice of a database name. Remember the name of the database. Finally,
		choose from the <i>Query</i> menu, <i>Execute (All or Selection)</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The script should run through without error. If it does not,
		make sure you have not only selected parts of the SQL script. In case
		you have made changes to the database name, check if you changed all
		of the old name tags correctly.
		</p>
		<h3>Updating the entryDB-file</h3> 
		<p>
		The last step is to
		configure the &quot;dbentry&quot; file. The &quot;dbentry&quot; file
		should stay in the same directory as the <i>.jar-files</i>. If you
		miss this step, you are asked at the start up of the Morphilizer or
		Morquery tool to do so. The configuration is very simple and quickly
		done, but you should pay attention to the order of each item you will
		have to put in.
		</p>
		<p>
		Open the file with a simple text editor. The first item to
		occur in this file is the IP-address or name of the server. For hard
		drive installations put &quot;localhost&quot; or
		&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. The second line must have the name of the
		database. Preset is <i>morphilodb</i>. If you have changed it, put
		down the new name. The third line should contain your password and the
		last line specifies your username. Nothing else should be in the file.
		Save and close it. You are now ready to start the morphological
		analysis.
