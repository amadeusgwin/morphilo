     <h2>Using the Toolset</h2>   
     <h3>General Procedure</h3>
		<p>After the installation procedure and database setup, you are
		ready to use the software. The software package is designed to analyze
		derivational morphology in the course of time using large corpora. It
		comprises several steps.</p>
		<p>First, the corpus data have to be pre-analyzed, that is,
		conveyed to a form that is easier to process in terms of derivational
		morphology. This is done by Morextractor. It assigns additional tags
		to the words of a corpus revealing possible affixes and compounds.
		Depending on the speed of your system, this may take up to <i>30</i>
		minutes for very large corpora, since the enumerated lists of suffixes
		and prefixes contain all allomorphemic variants, which add up to
		several <i>1,000</i> items.</p>
		<p>The second step involves manual work. The Morphilizer software
		will support you in correcting the automatic analysis wherever words
		are oversegmented. Each word has to be analyzed only once for each
		time period. All other occurrences are automatically readjusted and
		saved in the database.</p>
		<p>Once you have finished your analysis, you can query your data.
		For all queries start the Morquery tool by double clicking the
		respective jar-file.</p>
		<h3>Morextractor</h3>
		<p>Double click the morextractor.jar file to start working on
		diachronic morphological analyses.</p>

			title="MoreXtractor" />
		<p>A simple platform will enable you to browse to the folder of
		your tagged corpus files. Notice again that only <i>.pos</i>-files
		will be selectable. Morextractor will always process all files of the
		selected folder. If you wish to process single files, you have to copy
		them to separate folders and select them one after another. This
		ensures that you will not double-pick one file and thus this prevents
		skewing the quantitative analyses. Also select a destination where a
		file system consisting of several folders will be set up automatically
		by the software. The folder in which the preprocessed files are
		written to is called <i>wordlist</i>. You may also choose to restrict
		the analysis to one specific word form by checking the respective box.
		Otherwise choose the <i>all</i> check box. The text field at the
		bottom of the tool prompts you with possible errors, data
		inconsistencies, or the determination of the automatic analysis. Once
		all calculations are finished, you can proceed with finetuning these
		results using the Morphilizer tool.</p>
		<h3>Morphilizer</h3>
		<p>The following figure displays the user interface for the
		Morphilizer component.</p>
		<img src="../../images/morphilizer.png" width="700" alt="morphilizer"
			title="MorPhilizer" />
		<p>The first step is to choose the preprocessed file as described
		in the previous chapter. You find the file in the <i>wordlist</i>
		folder. Select it in the <i>file selection</i> section and choose a
		corpus in the <i>corpus specification</i> section from the drop down
		menu or by individual specification in the respective text fields.
		Then press <i>start</i>. Morphilizer will now check all tokens for an
		entry in the database. If tokens do already have an entry, the
		respective database tables are updated and the tokens are deleted from
		the <i>wordlist</i>-file. Depending on the size of the <i>wordlist</i>-file
		this may take several minutes.</p>
		<p>Once this mapping is done, the first entry is displayed in the
		<i>Derivation</i> section on the left side of the user interface. You
		have to make a choice on whether Morextractor assigned the correct
		affix or composition information. Use the radio buttons to correct
		false mappings or press the <i>skip</i>-button to exclude the entry in
		the analysis. All skipped items are saved to an extra list, which can
		be further analyzed at a later point in time.</p>
		<p>It is recommendable to consult the OED online dictionary to
		make the correct choices since the line between composition and
		affixation is far from clear-cut. This is especially true for
		diachronic data (e.g. the Middle English Period). From our experience,
		it is best to place the OED online interface right next to the
		Morphilizer tool. Whenever uncertainties in the analysis arise, you
		can check the time-usage pattern in the etymology section of the OED.
		When your sure of the morphological make-up of the token, press <i>OK</i>.
		The entry is now stored in the database. For the given time, you will
		not have to do the analysis of this item again. Once the database
		grows larger in size, there will be only little tokens left that need
		an extensive research on their affixation.</p>
		<p>PENN Parsed Corpora traditionally encode composita. If this is
		the case, they are automatically put in the <i>Compounding</i>
		section. Unfortunately, the underlying definition of what compounds
		are is not convincingly put into practice in terms of the corpus
		annotations as many composita are missed. If a word is really a
		compound but not annotated as such by the corpus annotations, select
		the <i>compound</i> radio button. The compositum will then be
		displayed at the right hand for further analysis. You may have to
		manually write each free morpheme of the compound to one of the
		specified text fields, select its word form, specify the head
		information, and make a choice on the compound type (endocentric,
		exocentric, dvandva, or appositional). After pressing the <i>OK</i>
		button here, each of the specified morphemes can be analyzed for its
		derivational structure in the <i>Derivation</i> section.</p>
		<p>Last, the <i>Processing Prompts</i> section gives you a
		feedback on the state and success of all major operations carried out
		(e.g. whether a word was successfully written to the database or
		failed to do so).</p>
		<h3>Morquery</h3>
		<p>The Morquery component is a query tool that is also available
		as an <a href="../servlets/MCRServlet3LoginServlet?url=http://localhost:8080/morphilo/software/download.xml">online
		interface</a>.</p>
		<img src="../../images/morquery.png" width="500" alt="morquery"
			title="MorQuery" />
		<p>It simplifies long SQL statements by selecting a combination of
		drop down menus and check boxes. You just have to choose the
		information of interest from the drop down menus and the information
		is translated to an SQL query and executed. The menus provide you with
		types and tokens of all affixes, compounds, words or subsets thereof,
		either morphemes or allomorphs as well as their position and head
		information. It is also possible to enter full SQL statements in the
		SQL query section. The most common queries can also be selected in a
		drop down menu. The <i>Results</i> text area displays all query
		results. They can be saved as a textfile by hitting the save button.</p>
